									<span>Some honest-hearted maids, will sing my dirge,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And tell to memory my death was noble,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Dying almost a martyr. That way he takes,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I purpose is my way too: sure he cannot</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Be so unmanly as to leave me here:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>If he do, maids will not so easily</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Trust men again: and yet he has not thank’d me</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For what I’ve done; no, not so much as kiss’d me;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And that, methinks, is not so well; nor scarcely</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Could I persuade him to become a freeman,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>He made such scruples of the wrong he did</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To me and to my father. Yet, I hope,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>When he considers more, this love of mine</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Will take more root within him: let him do</span>
									<br/>
									<span>What he will with me, so he use me kindly;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For use me so he shall, or I’ll proclaim him,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And to his face, no man. I’ll presently</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Provide him necessaries, and pack my clothes up,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And where there is a patch of ground I’ll venture,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>So he be with me: by him, like a shadow,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I’ll ever dwell. Within this hour the whoobub</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Will be all o’er the prison: I am then</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Kissing the man they look for. Farewell, father!</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Get many more such prisoners and such daughters,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And shortly you may keep yourself. Now to him! <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Exit.</i></span>
