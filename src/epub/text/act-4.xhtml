									<span>Yet I may bind those wounds up, that must open</span>

									<span>What a sweet face has Arcite! If wise Nature,</span>

									<span>With all her best endowments, all those beauties</span>
									<br/>
									<span>She sows into the births of noble bodies,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Were here a mortal woman, and had in her</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The coy denials of young maids, yet doubtless</span>
									<br/>
									<span>She would run mad for this man: what an eye⁠—</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of what a fiery sparkle and quick sweetness,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Has this young prince! here Love himself sits smiling!⁠—</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Just such another, wanton Ganymede</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Set Jove a-fire with, and enforc’d the god</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Snatch up the goodly boy and set him by him,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A shining constellation: what a brow,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of what a spacious majesty, he carries,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Arch’d like the great-ey’d Juno’s, but far sweeter,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Smoother than Pelops’ shoulder! Fame and honour,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Methinks, from hence, as from a promontory</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Pointed in heaven, should clap their wings, and sing</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To all the under-world, the loves and fights</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of gods, and such men near ’em. Palamon</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Is but his foil; to him, a mere dull shadow:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>He’s swarth and meagre, of an eye as heavy</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As if he had lost his mother; a still temper,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>No stirring in him, no alacrity;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of all this sprightly sharpness, not a smile;⁠—</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Yet these that we count errors, may become him:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Narcissus was a sad boy, but a heavenly.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>O, who can find the bent of woman’s fancy?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I am a fool, my reason is lost in me;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I have no choice, and I have lied so lewdly</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That women ought to beat me. On my knees</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I ask thy pardon, Palamon; thou art alone,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And only beautiful; and these the eyes,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>These the bright lamps of beauty, that command</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And threaten Love; and what young maid dare cross ’em?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>What a bold gravity, and yet inviting,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Has this brown manly face! O Love, this only</span>
									<br/>
									<span>From this hour is complexion. Lie there, Arcite;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Thou art a changeling to him, a mere gipsy,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And this the noble body. I am sotted,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Utterly lost; my virgin’s faith has fled me,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For, if my brother but even now had ask’d me</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Whether I lov’d, I had run mad for Arcite;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Now if my sister, more for Palamon.⁠—</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Stand both together.⁠—Now, come, ask me, brother;⁠—</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Alas, I know not!⁠—Ask me now, sweet sister;⁠—</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I may go look!⁠—What a mere child is fancy,</span>

									<span>That, having two fair gauds of equal sweetness,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Cannot distinguish, but must cry for both!</span>

							<td>That intemperate surfeit of her eye hath distemper’d the other senses: they may return and settle again to execute their preordained faculties; but they are now in a most extravagant vagary. This you must do: confine her to a place where the light may rather seem to steal in than be permitted. Take upon you, young sir, her friend, the name of Palamon; say you come to eat with her, and to commune of love; this will catch her attention, for this her mind beats upon; other objects, that are inserted ’tween her mind and eye, become the pranks and friskins of her madness: sing to her such green songs of love as she says Palamon hath sung in prison; come to her, stuck in as sweet flowers as the season is mistress of, and thereto make an addition of some other compounded odours, which are grateful to the sense; all this shall become Palamon, for Palamon can sing, and Palamon is sweet, and every good thing: desire to eat with her, carve her, drink to her, and still among intermingle your petition of grace and acceptance into her favour: learn what maids have been her companions and play-feres; and let them repair to her with Palamon in their mouths, and appear with tokens, as if they suggested for him. It is a falsehood she is in, which is with falsehoods to be combated. This may bring her to eat, to sleep, and reduce what’s now out of square in her into their former law and regiment: I have seen it approved, how many times I know not; but to make the number more I have great hope in this. I will, between the passages of this project, come in with my appliance. Let us put it in execution; and hasten the success, which, doubt not, will bring forth comfort. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Exeunt.</i></td>
