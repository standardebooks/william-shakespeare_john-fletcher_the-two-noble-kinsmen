									<span>His part is play’d, and, though it were too short,</span>

									<br/>
									<span>The blissful dew of heaven does arrowze you:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The powerful Venus well hath grac’d her altar,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And given you your love; our master Mars</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Hath vouch’d his oracle, and to Arcite gave</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The grace of the contention: so the deities</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Have show’d due justice.⁠—Bear this hence.</span>
